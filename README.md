# Roman numerals TDD kata

Test-driven development is a software development process that
basically puts writing a failing unit test before modifying your
production code. This repository provides scaffolds for various
programming languages for hassle-free first steps in the world
of TDD by solving a simple task.

# The task

Your task is the following: Practicing test-driven development,
implement a function that converts Arabic numbers (1-3999) to
Roman numerals.

If your memory of Roman numerals is a little foggy, you can head over
to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)
or refer to this conveniently placed table:

| Ones     |   | Tens      |   | Hundreds   |   | Thousands  |
|----------|---|-----------|---|------------|---|------------|
| 1 = I    |   | 10 = X    |   | 100 = C    |   | 1000 = M   |
| 2 = II   |   | 20 = XX   |   | 200 = CC   |   | 2000 = MM  |
| 3 = III  |   | 30 = XXX  |   | 300 = CCC  |   | 3000 = MMM |
| 4 = IV   |   | 40 = XL   |   | 400 = CD   |   |            |
| 5 = V    |   | 50 = L    |   | 500 = D    |   |            |
| 6 = VI   |   | 60 = LX   |   | 600 = DC   |   |            |
| 7 = VII  |   | 70 = LXX  |   | 700 = DCC  |   |            |
| 8 = VIII |   | 80 = LXXX |   | 800 = DCCC |   |            |
| 9 = IX   |   | 90 = XC   |   | 900 = CM   |   |            |

You can combine the numbers listed above, ordering larger to smaller
numbers left to right. Here are a few examples:

*   407 = CDVII
*   2017 = MMXVII
*   3888 = MMMDCCCLXXXVIII
